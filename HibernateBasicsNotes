Hibernate Tutorial
------------------------

Prerequisite
        1.java Core-->basic concepts are very Important
        2.JDBC     -->Basic JDBC API
        3.Database -->Basic Of Database tables , Keys and queries


Q.What is hibernate? ORM(Object relational Mapping)
Ans. Hibernate is a java framework that simplies he development of java    applicaion to interact with the database.

  ->Hibernate is ORM(Object Relational Mapping) tool
  ->Hibernate is an Open source, lightweight.
  ->Hibernate is a non -invasive framework , means it won't forces the programmers to extend/implement any class/interface
  ->it is invented by Gavin King in 2001.
  ->Any type of application can build with Hibernate Framework.


Traditional way to Save Data(JDBC)
----------------------------------

we write code manually to store objects(data) t database using JDBC
DAO(data access Object)

where hibernate play its role
-----------------------------
Now it is done automatically by hibernate

we can map by using xml/annotation any one.


Hibernate configuration in xml
---------------------------------

Basics commonly used hibernate annotation
-----------------------------------------
@Entity -> use to mark any class as entity (means same treated as table in database or created table with same class name automatically in database)
@Table  -> use to change the table details
@Id     -> use to mark column as id(primary key)
@GeneratedValue ->hinernate will automatically generate values for that using an internal sequence therefore we don't have to set it manually.
@Column ->Can be used to specify column mappings. For example, to change the column name in the associated table in database.
@Transient -> this tells hibernate not to save this field.
@Temporal -over a date field tells hibernate the format in which the date needs to be saved.
@Lob ->tells hibernate that this is a large object, not a simple object
@OneToOne , @OneToMany, @ManyToOne , @JoinColumn etc


FETCH DATA
-----------------------------------------------
we can use two method of session get() and load()
get()
------------------------------
1. get method of hibernate session returns null if object is not found in cache as well as on database.
2. get() involve database hit if object doesn't exists in Session Cache and returns a fully initialized object which
   may involve several database call
3. Use if you are not sure that object exists in db or not

load()
------------------------------
1.load() method throws
  ObjectNotFoundException if object is not found on cache as well as on database but never return null.
2. load method can return proxy in place and only initialize the object or hit the database if any method other
   than getId() is called on persistent or entity object .This lazy initialization increases the performance.
3. Use if you are sure that object exists.


@EmbeddableAnnotation
------------------------

@OneToOneMapping
----------------------

@OneToManyMapping and @ManyToOneMapping
----------------------

@ManyToManyMapping
